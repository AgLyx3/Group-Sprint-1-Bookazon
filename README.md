## 🏗️ Architecture and Design

We've applied SOLID principles to create a robust, extensible architecture:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **S**ingle Responsibility | Each class has one job and does it well |
| **O**pen/Closed | Open for extension, closed for modification |
| **L**iskov Substitution | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types |
| **I**nterface Segregation | Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface |
| **D**ependency Inversion | Depend on abstractions, not on concretions |
